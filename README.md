Application Name: ParkingHelpmate
Version: 1.0

Application Description: An Android application that helps you track your parking meter time and navigate back to your parking spot from any location. It basically allows you to set a parking meter time and a pre-timer alert and thereby, sends the notifications once before the timer expires and the other one when the timer runs out. Users can also add/save notes about the location. Apart from these feature, it also allows the user to tag the vehicle location and get the precise directions from current location to previously tagged location.
- Application developed using Android 4.3 API level 18.
- Application uses Google maps Android API V2

Future Enhancements: 
We would like to add some extra features to our application in future:
- Countdown timer
- Auto tag location when you set the meter time
- Ability to snap and save picture 
- Adjust the volume of alert tones
- Share parking information like the meter timer, saved notes, location etc via email or text 
- Alert sound when close to destination
